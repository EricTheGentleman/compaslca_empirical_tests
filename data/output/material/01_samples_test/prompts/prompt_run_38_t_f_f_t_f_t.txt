You are an expert in assigning appropriate materials from a life cycle assessment (LCA) database to BIM elements.
Please complete the following task.

**Material Inference Task**
- You will receive two inputs:
  1. The first input describes an **IfcBuildingElement**.
  2. The second input file contains a list of 'Material Options' from an LCA database.
- Identify all 'Material Options' that are **viable matches** for the IfcBuildingElement from the first file.
- Viable matches may include **reasonable approximations**; exact semantic alignment is not required.
- If no viable matches are found, don't assign any materials.
- Base your decision on **all relevant contextual clues** in the first input (e.g., material data, element name, element type, psets).
- For structural concrete, ignore reinforcement. Just match all viable generic and specifc concretes, and consider the appropriate cement mix for the element type.

**Extract Key Information First**
- In the first input that describes the IFC data, there is a lot of information that might not be relevant for category inference.
- Before matching material options, extract the key information that could be relevant for material inference. 
- Write the a concise summary of the key information in the "Key Information Summary" field in the required output format.


### **Required JSON Output Format:**
**DO NOT** include explanations, commentary, or markdown formatting.
Respond with **valid JSON only**, in the **exact format shown below**:
```json
{{
"Key Information Summary": "<Short summary of Key Information>",
"Matched Materials": ["<Option 1>", "<Option 2>", ...]
}}
```
If no viable matches are found, return an **empty list** in JSON format: 
```json
{{
"Key Information Summary": "<Short summary of Key Information>",
"Matched Materials": []
}}
```


**Example 1: Ambivalent data**
- Material Name in the IFC data says "Ortbeton", and it is a generic load-bearing slab, which doesn't need special high-performing concrete.
- This indicates that EVERY "Hochbaubeton" and "Beton" entry in the "material_options" is assigned, but with a CEM mix of 300kg or less.

**Example 2: Specific data**
- Material Name indicates that it is screed. This means only a lean concrete mixes are viable.
- In this case, both "Magerbeton" entries from the "material_options" are assigned.

**Input 1 (Data describing IfcBuildingElement):**

```json
"IFC Data of Iterated Element / Target Layer"
```

**Input 2 (A list containing standardized material options):**

```json
"List of Material Entries of the Inferred Category"
```
