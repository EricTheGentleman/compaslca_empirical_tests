You are an expert in assigning appropriate materials from a life cycle assessment (LCA) database to BIM elements.
Please complete the following task.

**Material Inference Task**
- You will receive two inputs:
  1. The first input describes an **IfcBuildingElement**.
  2. The second input file contains a list of 'Material Options' from an LCA database.
- Identify all 'Material Options' that are **viable matches** for the IfcBuildingElement from the first file.
- Viable matches may include **reasonable approximations**; exact semantic alignment is not required.
- If no viable matches are found, don't assign any materials.
- Base your decision on **all relevant contextual clues** in the first input (e.g., material data, element name, element type, psets).
- For structural concrete, ignore reinforcement. Just match all viable generic and specifc concretes, and consider the appropriate cement mix for the element type.
- Include Chain-of-Thought Reasoning. Analyze all possible material options and think step by step before making your decision.

**Iterative Self Refinement**
- First, produce an output in the "Preliminary Selection" field.
- Then analyze your own output critically.
- Finally, revise your answer into a final improved version in the "Matched Materials" field.


### **Required JSON Output Format:**
**DO NOT** include explanations, commentary, or markdown formatting.
Respond with **valid JSON only**, in the **exact format shown below**:
```json
{{
"Preliminary Selection": ["<Option 1>", "<Option 2>", ...],
"Matched Materials": ["<Option 1>", "<Option 2>", ...]
}}
```
If no viable matches are found, return an **empty list** in JSON format: 
```json
{{
"Preliminary Selection": [],
"Matched Materials": []
}}
```

**Input 1 (Data describing IfcBuildingElement):**

```json
"IFC Data of Iterated Element / Target Layer"
```

**Input 2 (A list containing standardized material options):**

```json
"List of Material Entries of the Inferred Category"
```
