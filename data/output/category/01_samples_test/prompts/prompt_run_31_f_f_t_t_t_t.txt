You are an expert in classifying BIM elements to life cycle assessment (LCA) categories.
Please complete the following task.

**Category Inference Task**
- You will receive two inputs:
  1. The first input describes an **IfcBuildingElement**.
  2. The second input file contains a list of 'Categories' from an LCA database.
- Identify the most accurate category for the IfcBuildingElement from the first file.
- In general, if a material name is available, then prioritize matching the category based on the material name, rather than something else.
- You must match a category where you anticipate finding viable material entries for the IfcBuildingElement.
- If the IfcBuildingElement cannot be clearly classified, assign an empty list.
- If there is no material name, base your decision on **all other relevant contextual clues** in the first input (e.g., element name, element type, psets).
- Include Chain-of-Thought Reasoning. Analyze all possible categories and think step by step before making your decision.

**Extract Key Information First**
- In the first input that describes the IFC data, there is a lot of information that might not be relevant for category inference.
- Before matching a category, extract the key information that could be relevant for category inference. 
- Write the a concise summary of the key information in the "Key Information Summary" field in the required output format.


**Iterative Self Refinement**
- First, produce an output in the "Preliminary Selection" field.
- Then analyze your own output critically.
- Finally, revise your answer into a final improved version in the "Matched Category" field.


### **Required JSON Output Format:**
**DO NOT** include explanations, commentary, or markdown formatting.
Respond with **valid JSON only**, in the **exact format shown below**:
```json
{{
"Key Information Summary": "<Short summary of Key Information>",
"Preliminary Selection": "<Preliminary Category Choice>",
"Matched Category": "<Final Category Choice>"
}}
```
If no viable match is found, return "None" for the "Matched Category" key:
```json
{{
"Key Information Summary": "<Short summary of Key Information>",
"Preliminary Selection": "<Preliminary Category Choice | None>",
"Matched Category": "None"
}}
```


**Example 1: Clear Match**    
- If the Material Descriptor or Element Name in the IFC data mentions "Concrete", "Insulation", "Wood", "Brick", etc., then match the corresponding category.

**Example 2: Implicit Match**
- If the IFC input is somewhat vague, and it can be deduced that it is for instance a "floor covering" without specifically mentioning it, then the corresponding category is still matched.
- Same applies for other types of IFC inputs. If there is enough data such that only one category could be potentially matched, then that category should be matched.

**Example 3: True Negative**
- If the IFC input specifies the entity IfcSlab, IfcWall, etc. but there is no indication in the material data or metadata for the type of construction or material, then no category should be matched.
- In general, if the IFC input has too little data to classify it reliably into a category, then no category should be matched.

**Input 1 (Data describing IfcBuildingElement):**

```json
"IFC Data of Iterated Element / Target Layer"
```

**Input 2 (A list containing categories for an LCA database):**

```json
"List of Material Entries of the Inferred Category"
```
