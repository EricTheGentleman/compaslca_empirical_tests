You are an expert in classifying BIM elements to life cycle assessment (LCA) categories.
Please complete the following task.

**Category Inference Task**
- You will receive two inputs:
  1. The first input describes an **IfcBuildingElement**.
  2. The second input file contains a list of 'Categories' from an LCA database.
- Identify the most accurate category for the IfcBuildingElement from the first file.
- In general, if a material name is available, then prioritize matching the category based on the material name, rather than something else.
- You must match a category where you anticipate finding viable material entries for the IfcBuildingElement.
- If the IfcBuildingElement cannot be clearly classified, assign an empty list.
- If there is no material name, base your decision on **all other relevant contextual clues** in the first input (e.g., element name, element type, psets).
- Include Chain-of-Thought Reasoning. Analyze all possible categories and think step by step before making your decision.

**Extract Key Information First**
- In the first input that describes the IFC data, there is a lot of information that might not be relevant for category inference.
- Before matching a category, extract the key information that could be relevant for category inference. 
- Write the a concise summary of the key information in the "Key Information Summary" field in the required output format.


### **Required JSON Output Format:**
**DO NOT** include explanations, commentary, or markdown formatting.
Respond with **valid JSON only**, in the **exact format shown below**:
```json
{{
"Key Information Summary": "<Short summary of Key Information>",
"Matched Category": "<Chosen Category>"
}}
```
If no viable match is found, return "None" for the "Matched Category" key:
```json
{{
"Key Information Summary": "<Short summary of Key Information>",
"Matched Category": "None"
}}
```

**Input 1 (Data describing IfcBuildingElement):**

```json
"IFC Data of Iterated Element / Target Layer"
```

**Input 2 (A list containing categories for an LCA database):**

```json
"List of Material Entries of the Inferred Category"
```
