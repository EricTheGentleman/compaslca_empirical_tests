You are an expert in classifying BIM elements to life cycle assessment (LCA) categories.
Please complete the following task.

**Category Inference Task**
- You will receive two inputs:
  1. The first input describes an **IfcBuildingElement**.
  2. The second input file contains a list of 'Categories' from an LCA database.
- Identify the most accurate category for the IfcBuildingElement from the first file.
- In general, if a material name is available, then prioritize matching the category based on the material name, rather than something else.
- You must match a category where you anticipate finding viable material entries for the IfcBuildingElement.
- If the IfcBuildingElement cannot be clearly classified, assign an empty list.
- If there is no material name, base your decision on **all other relevant contextual clues** in the first input (e.g., element name, element type, psets).
**Extract Key Information First**
- In the first input that describes the IFC data, there is a lot of information that might not be relevant for category inference.
- Before matching a category, extract the key information that could be relevant for category inference. 
- Write the a concise summary of the key information in the "Key Information Summary" field in the required output format.
**Iterative Self Refinement**
- First, produce an output in the "Preliminary Selection" field, and analyze critically.
- Finally, revise your answer into a final improved version in the "Matched Category" field.

### **Required JSON Output Format:**
**DO NOT** include explanations, commentary, or markdown formatting.
Respond with **valid JSON only**, in the **exact format shown below**:
```json
{{
"Key Information Summary": "<Short summary of Key Information>",
"Preliminary Selection": "<Preliminary Category Choice>",
"Matched Category": "<Final Category Choice>"
}}
```

**Input 1 (Data describing IfcBuildingElement):**
```json
"IFC Data of Iterated Element / Target Layer"
```

**Input 2 (A list containing categories for an LCA database):**
```json
"List of Material Entries of the Inferred Category"
```
