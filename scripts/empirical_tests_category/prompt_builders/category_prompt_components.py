    "content_framing": "Accuracy matters a lot! Incorrect answers will strongly impact important downstream processes.",

    # Should the LLM justify it's decision at the end?
    "decision_justification": '''
**Decision Justification**
- After choosing a category, include a short decision justification in the corresponding output field.
- Highlight any textual clues (like element name or material descriptors), geometric properties, or property sets that were useful in matching the element to the chosen category.
- Keep the explanation clear and concise.

    "analysis_granularity_efficient": "Respond quickly and concisely. Minimize latency and token usage by focusing only on the most relevant fields.",
    "analysis_granularity_thorough": "Latency and token usage are not a concern â€” prioritize completeness and rigor in your reasoning.",

    # Should the LLM give a preliminary answer first, and then evaluate it / improve upon its answer?
    "iterative_self_refinement": '''
**Iterative Self Refinement**
- First, produce a output in the preliminary matched category field.
- Then analyze your own output critically.
- Finally, revise your answer into a final improved version in the matched category field.

    # Should the LLM summarize the most important parts first?
    "summarize_first": '''
**Summarize the Key Information**
- Within the JSON file that describes the BIM data, there is a lot of information that might not be relevant for category inference.
- Before matching a category, summarize the key information that could be relevant for the category inference. 
- Write the summary in the respective key information summary field in the required output format.

    "scenario_explanation": '''
**Matching Scenarios**
- If the available data is insufficient to support a confident match, assign the category "None".
- If the BIM data represents a compound system (e.g., a layered floor or wall build-up without clear material separation), assign the category "None".
- Only assign a category if there is enough reliable data to justify a confident match.
